/**
 * This class is intended to resolve some security issues regarding JOCL configuration files.
 * <p>
 * To properly configure the database pool, the database password should be informed inside
 *   these files. Since this might trigger some security issues under production environment,
 *   we decided to create a secure version.
 * <p>
 * The idea here is to use stop sending the password as parameter in the constructor of the
 *   {@value DriverManagerConnectionFactory} class, and start identifying a file (in the filesystem
 *   or bundled in some JAR archive) which will be encrypted and containing only the user's password.
 * <p>
 * Internally, this implementation will decrypt the content of the file, and use it as password
 *   to the parent Class. This will avoid setting explicitly the password in the configuration file.
